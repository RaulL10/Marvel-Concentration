# Marvel Madness!

## INTRO
This game is my own blend of a well known memory game, Concentration. Instead of boring old numbers, we use the MCU's first 6 Avengers and a few more characters as cards. Do your best to match them all and try and find the heroes in as few clicks as you can!

#### GETTING STARTED

_INSTRUCTIONS_ 
--- The rules are simple. There are 8 MCU characters. You have 35 clicks to try and match all 8 pairs. If the game is completed in less than 35 clicks the you **_WIN_**. If you use more than the allowed clicks you **_LOSE_**.

##### NEXT STEPS

For future updates to the game, the game can countdown the clicks you have left. In addition, the game can have difficulty levels to really test your memory skills!
